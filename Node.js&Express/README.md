# Node.js & Express
This repository contains backend applications and RESTful APIs built using Node.js and Express.js. Each project demonstrates server-side development concepts such as routing, middleware, CRUD operations, database integration, authentication, and API design. The goal is to create efficient, scalable, and maintainable backend solutions that can serve as standalone applications or as part of larger systems.
